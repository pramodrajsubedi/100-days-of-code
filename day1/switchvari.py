#  let's create a variable to store the numerical data
a = 123
#  here a stores the numerical value 123
# now, let's create a new variableb
b= 456
#  now lets create a new variableand  switch the value of a and b
c = b
# here c is equals to b, and b,c contains the same value
#  let's print the value of variables
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
#  here print(c) gives the value same as b
