# here we discuss about elif statement
# elif statement is used to check multiple conditions
# if the first condition is false then it will check the second condition and so on
# if condition1:
#     do this
# elif condition2:
#     do this
# else:
#     do this

# you can put elif between else and if statement


# if condition:
#     if another condition:
#        do this
#     else:
#         do this
# else:
#     do this

# this is nested if/else statements
# nested statement is inside the if statement


#use if/elif/else for multiple condition 
# if condition1:
#     do this
# if condition2:
#     do this
# if condition3:
#     do this
